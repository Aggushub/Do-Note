## üìñ Story of Creation

Like most developers, I had **a mind full of project ideas**, scattered across my phone‚Äôs to-do list app. When I was figuring out which one to build first, a new idea struck me:

> ‚ÄúWhy not start by building a to-do list app myself and use that to organize the rest?‚Äù

It seemed like the perfect launchpad ‚Äî but as I began planning, I realized: the web is already **flooded with countless To-Do List projects**. It felt too repetitive, too obvious.

So I paused and thought ‚Äî *how could I make this more personal and unique?*

That‚Äôs when the idea evolved.

Instead of making just another checklist tool, I decided to **combine two powerful productivity tools ‚Äî a To-Do List and a Notes App** ‚Äî into one page, **with shared styling, interaction, and purpose**. That gave birth to the idea of **Do-Notes** ‚Äî short for *‚ÄúDo‚Äù (your tasks) + ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù (your ideas)*.

This project was built as part of my **Frontend Development course on Udemy**, and it helped me apply every concept I learned in a meaningful way.
